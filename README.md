# **SafeCode**

# Introduction
This project was carried out during the 4th year of the EPITECH school, which has a 5-year curriculum. During this year, which we spent in Brussels and which was therefore international, we were able to learn to specialise in cybersecurity.<br>
In addition to monthly projects, we had to carry out a larger-scale 8-month project called the ‘Capstone’.<br>
The result was SafeCode, a vulnerability scanner.

## The goal of the Capstone ?
The aim of the Capstone project was to create a monetisable cybersecurity solution that would cover the entire business process.
Regular team meetings, meetings with our superiors, our attendance, our results and our presentations.
All these points were noted.
