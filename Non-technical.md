## FAQ
### **- My zip doesn't work**
→ Check your connexion and you are logged well.<br>
→ Check that it is not empty or corrupted.<br>
→ Is it a real `.zip` and not with an hiden dot?<br>

### **- The report doesn't detect anything**
→ Is your language supported?<br>
→ Check your licence.<br>
→ Are you too good in code?<br>

### **- Is it secure?**
→ All the code we keep is encrypted, so we don't have access to it.<br>
→ We only keep the last analyse, never the others.<br>
