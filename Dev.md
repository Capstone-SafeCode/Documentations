# GitHub Integration Guide

This documentation explains how to integrate GitHub authentication and access into your Go project.

---

## 1. Create a GitHub OAuth Application

To allow users to log in via GitHub, you need to create an OAuth application on GitHub:

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click on **"New OAuth App"**
3. Fill in the fields:
   - **Application name**: `Safecode`
   - **Homepage URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `http://localhost:3000/auth/github/callback`
4. Click **"Register application"**
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

---

## 2. Environment Configuration

Store your GitHub credentials in your `.env` file:

```env
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```
Make sure your Go application loads this .env file

3. **Create two routes**
   - 'auth/github' to redirect on Github Authentification page
   - 'auth/github/callback to come back on the application after Github Autorization
     
  After **callback**, the user is authenticated on the application and has a Github access Token.
  This Access Token is mendatory to use Github User's data, like repository or organisation.
  See the Github API documentation, to see al 
  
4. **GitHub Integration in This Project**
In this project, GitHub is used to allow the user to test a repository's code directly inside the app:

  - The user provides the HTTPS URL of a GitHub repository.
  - The app fetches the repository code and executes analysis or testing.
  - The GitHub Access Token is used to access private repositories if needed.

5. **Useful Links**
  - GitHub OAuth Apps Documentation
  - GitHub REST API Docs
  - godotenv (for loading .env in Go)

6. **Notes**
  - Don't forget to protect your .env file â€” never commit it to your repository.
  - You can store the access token in a session, database, or JWT, depending on your auth strategy.
  - Rate limiting applies to GitHub API requests. Use appropriate headers or tokens.
